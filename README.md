# Care Connect

Welcome to **Care Connect**, an innovative AI-powered health assistant built using Flutter. This project aims to replicate the experience of a doctor's consultation, offering patients detailed and personalized medical advice. Powered by the Gemini API, **Care Connect** leverages cutting-edge AI to provide accurate, real-time health assessments.

## Project Overview

**Care Connect** is designed to serve as a virtual healthcare advisor. It collects comprehensive patient information, including symptoms and medical history, and uses this data to offer informed health advice. The goal is to provide a user-friendly experience that mirrors a traditional doctor’s visit, ensuring that patients receive the attention and guidance they need.

### Key Features

- **Detailed Patient History Collection**: The chatbot systematically gathers extensive patient information, ensuring all relevant details are considered before providing any advice. It asks the same questions a doctor would during an in-person consultation.

- **Medical Report Analysis**: **Care Connect** can analyze uploaded medical reports, offering insights and guidance based on the data provided. This feature enhances the accuracy of its recommendations, making it a reliable tool for health advice.

- **Simulated Doctor Consultation**: The AI is programmed to replicate a real-life doctor's consultation, engaging patients in a natural, conversational manner. This ensures that patients feel comfortable and well-attended to throughout the interaction.

### Future Development

**Care Connect** is an evolving project with several planned enhancements:

- **Conversation Storage**: Implementing Firebase integration to store patient conversations securely, allowing for future reference and continuity of care.

- **Health Monitoring Tools Integration**: Plans to integrate APIs for tools like blood pressure and blood sugar monitoring, enabling the bot to assess a patient’s current health status and provide tailored advice.

- **Location-Based Doctor Recommendations**: Developing a feature that suggests nearby healthcare professionals based on the patient's location and condition, ensuring timely and appropriate medical attention.

- **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Further training and refinement of the AI model to improve its diagnostic accuracy and expand its knowledge base across various medical domains.
